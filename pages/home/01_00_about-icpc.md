# About the ICPC Asia Pacific Championship

With the growth of ICPC in Asia Pacific countries and around the world, from the cycle 2023-2024, the ICPC Asia Pacific will change from a three-tier system (Preliminary, Regional, World Finals) to a four-tier system (Preliminary, Regional, Super-Regional, World Finals). The super-regional tier of ICPC Asia Pacific will be called **"The ICPC Asia Pacific Championship."** 

As this Super-Regional is invitational only, students from universities in West Pacific and Southeast Asia, including South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, Cambodia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Laos, will be able to participate in the ICPC Asia Pacific Championship through the regional contests. For more information on regional contests, visit the [ICPC Regional Finder](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/APSEPC).
