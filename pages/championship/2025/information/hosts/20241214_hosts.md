We have a wide range of committee members from different regionals to create the ICPC Asia Pacific Championship, ensuring a diverse and talented organizing committee that reflects the best of competitive programming. See the list of organizing committee members in the [committee](committee) page.

This championship wouldn't be possible without the support of our hosts and organizers:

- Hosted by the National University of Singapore (NUS) School of Computing, part of the <a href="https://50years.comp.nus.edu.sg/">50th anniversary of the NUS School of Computing</a>.
- Organized by Centre for Nurturing Computing Excellence (CeNCE)
